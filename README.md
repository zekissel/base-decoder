# base-decoder
Converts numbers of varying bits and bases into decimal, binary, hexadecimal, and signed decimal (2's complement)

An improvement from the previous "unsigned decoder", this decoder works in 8 bit, 16 bit, and 32 bit integer sizes.
Choose the bit size of the input, the base of the input (0x denotes hexadecimal, 0b denotes binary, no prefix denotes decimal), enter an integer of the appropiate base, and press convert.
Accepts negative and positive decimals.

Errors for incorrect base and exceeding limit are included. No 64 bit functionality.
GUI optimized for Windows; MAC and Linux users might see window displayed incorrectly / missing labels.
